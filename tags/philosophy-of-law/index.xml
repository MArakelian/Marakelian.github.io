      <description>This Thursday we&amp;rsquo;re taking a look at HLA Hart&amp;rsquo;s seminal work: The Concept of Law. It was Hart&amp;rsquo;s most complete formulation of his legal postivism (in part because he updated it over the course of his career).
We&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at the intro to the newest edition, written by legal philosopher Leslie Green, who brilliantly explains the various parts of Hart&amp;rsquo;s theory that have been misunderstood.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Question  What are the validity conditions for a law? Under what conditions do laws exist?
 Legal Positivism  The existence laws depends on social facts and not on the merits of its content.  Austin&amp;rsquo;s Take  The existence of law is one thing its merit and demerit another. Whether it be or be not is one inquiry; whether it be or be not comfortable to an assumed standard is a different inquiry.</description>
