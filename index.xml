      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m a lawyer and philosophy graduate student who leads a live discussion on a different topic in philosophy or law each week (right now, they&amp;rsquo;re Thurday nights at 7:00pm edt). My main interest is in ethics, epistemology, and philosophy of law, but I&amp;rsquo;m open to almost any topic which interests people. My motivation was to learn about philoosphy outside of the classroom and to have discussions with folks whose diverse experiences would lead to richer discussion.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Question  What are the validity conditions for a law? Under what conditions do laws exist?
 Legal Positivism  The existence laws depends on social facts and not on the merits of its content.  Austin&amp;rsquo;s Take  The existence of law is one thing its merit and demerit another. Whether it be or be not is one inquiry; whether it be or be not comfortable to an assumed standard is a different inquiry.</description>
