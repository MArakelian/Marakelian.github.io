I&rsquo;m a lawyer and philosophy graduate student who leads a live discussion on a different topic in philosophy or law each week (right now, they&rsquo;re Thurday nights at 7:00pm edt). My main interest is in ethics, epistemology, and philosophy of law, but I&rsquo;m open to almost any topic which interests people. My motivation was to learn about philoosphy outside of the classroom and to have discussions with folks whose diverse experiences would lead to richer discussion." />
